This project builds a Slack app using Bolt for JavaScript. 

Can you pull up the notes from our meeting last month? As often as we have meetings, they finish and are forgotten.
Whatever notes existed scribbled on that coffee stained napkin are long gone. dnotes was designed to keep things moving by creating,
organizing, and sharing notes via Google Docs that are shared to the conversations you want on Slack. dnotes keeps you on the same page. 

Hermann Ebbinghaus found that on average “more than 50% of what we learn is forgotten within an hour, 2/3rd's by the end of the day and 80% by
the end of the month”. How can you easily get notes attached to each meeting? dnotes. dnotes is a Slack app that integrates Google Docs and
Slack to bring you meeting notes shared into the Slack conversations that you want. Get rid off the hassle and have notes ready to go at the
click of a few buttons. 

Whether there is a meeting or not, our project (dnotes) simplifies the process of producing notes for conversations in Slack by creating,
organizing, and sharing via Google Docs. dnotes is designed to be used by anyone who uses Slack. It simplifies the process of creating notes
at the click of a few buttons. We’ve built our home page to display upcoming meetings with the option to join the meeting. We also display past
meetings for the user with the option to view the notes that were created specific to that meeting. This feature would redirect the user at a
click of a button to the document as opposed to the traditional way of things where the steps would akin to first login onto Google, sift
through the many documents, open and close the many Google Docs before maybe finding the one needed. This is an example of how our app
simplifies a process and makes it easy to use. The home page also has buttons towards the top, “create meeting” and “create note”. The
“create meeting” button opens a modal view with basic information such as the conversation to post the meeting notes in, the meeting information
(title of document/meeting, time, date), and the option of specifying a sub-folder. The “create note” button has a similar modal view with the
exception of meeting information, this feature’s intended use is for wanting to create a document to jot down ideas to share in a Slack
conversation without requiring the need for a meeting. The “create meeting” button has the feature of then sending a message one hour before
the meeting time in the designated Slack conversation. The “create note” button simply shares the document with the specified information
to the chosen Slack conversation. Within a Slack conversation in which a document was shared, a message from the dnotes Slack bot gives
information regarding the document and a button that redirects the user to those specified notes. If it’s a meeting note then a checkbox
with if the meeting is complete or not, allows the user to check the box to indicate the meeting is now complete which will change the
editing feature of the document to viewing. This feature was thought of as a way to protect the integrity of the content of the meeting notes.
